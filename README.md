📌 Project Description
A fully serverless backend for managing To-Do tasks using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. This project provides RESTful API endpoints to perform Create, Read, and Delete operations on tasks.

🚀 AWS Lambda handles backend logic for each operation

🌐 API Gateway exposes the RESTful endpoints

📦 DynamoDB stores task data with taskId, name, and completed fields

🔐 CORS and IAM roles implemented for secure access

🧪 Tested using Postman for request/response validation

🗂️ Includes architecture diagram and modular Lambda function structure
